      <p> Taking your dog for a walk is one of the simplest ways fo them to get exercise. All dogs, no matter the breed, like going on walks.
        Whether its at a park or around the block, it gets you out of the house and it makes them tired.</p></div>
    <h2> Runs </h2>
      <p> If you're a more athletic owner, maybe running is more your speed? Or maybe you just want to shoot of some balls and let your dog
        sprint across a wide open field. Either way, it's a great way to get your dog exercise. Just remember, dogs aren't made to be long
        distance runners, so keep the run to something manageable and always bring water.</p>
