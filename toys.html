           <td>Can be used for all stages of dog life! When your puppy is teething, giving them something to chew on can save
              your furniture and save you from stress. It can also give your dog a way to tire themselves out without having to
              leave your home!</td>

           <td>Giving your dog a good game of tug of war can get make them tired and also give the two of you some bonding time.
           And, if you teach your dog when it's time to play and when it's to "drop it" you can save your clothes or anything else you
         might not want in their mouth. </td>

         <th>Plush Toys</th>
         <td>Plush toys are just adorable toys that you and your dog can enjoy! You can either get sturdy pet toys or even a regular stuffed
         animal can work too (just tear or the tags or anything on it that your dog can choke on)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
       <th>Puzzle Toys</th>
       <td> Your dog needs brain work too, you know. Puzzle toys work to stimulate a dog's brain. By solving different puzzles, your dog is constantly geting a mental workout
       and gets tired in the process!</td>
