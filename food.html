    <h2> Kibble </h2>
    <div class="details">
      <a href="Hundefutter.jpg"><img src= "Hundefutter.jpg" class="floatright" height="300" width="250" alt="kibble"></a>
      <p> Kibble is just mashed up ingredients that have been shaped into pellets. Some dog owners like to fight over dry vs wet food, but, as long as you read
        the ingredients in your brand and make sure that the food has a good amount of proteins - that means meat, don't go for the corn meal kibble -, fats,
        and no preservatives, your dog should be healthy. And you don't have to stop at just kibble! You can mix a variety of ingredients into their bowl! </p>

    <h2> Meat </h2>
      <p> Yes, yes, a thousand times YES! Dogs are carnivores so they can have meat. But you don't have to go above and beyond your bank account to find meat
      for your dog. Dogs love chicken, turkey, beef, pork, really any meat humans eat is okay for dogs. You just have to watch the meat you give them. If it has
    bones in it then that's a no go because dogs can choke or puncture their insides on sharp bones in their food. Avoid fatty meats too, its just not healthy for them.
  And if it looks questionable (old, smelly, moldy), don't give it to your pup, they aren't garbage cans. </p>

    <h2> Bones and Treats </h2>
    <div class="details">
      <a href="Raw-Meat.jpg"><img src= "Raw-Meat.jpg" class="floatright" height="300" width="250" alt="raw meat"></a>
      <p> Same concept as above. If it looks like your dog could choke on it then take it away. Bones and chews shouldn't be able to fit into your pup's mouth, they
      could easily swallow and choke on it if you turn your back. Now don't be scared, bones are good! Even one bone a week can clean your dog's teeth and give them a way
      to tire themselves out. Just always keep an eye on your dog if they're chewing on a bone. For treats, just make sure you are giving them something that isn't high
      carb and low, crude proteins. Give them food that is well rounded and healthy. You don't even have to go out for dog treats, you could just go to your fridge!
      Dogs can eat apples, peanut butter,carrots, cucumbers, zucchinis, lettuce, meat, and many other things!  </p>
