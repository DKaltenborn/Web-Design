    <h3> Do you bring dogs directly to people's homes? </h3>

        <p> Yes and no. We aren't some place to online shop for your new pup but we do put
        prospective dog owners in touch with shelters and fosters from around the area that you
        may not have even heard of. If transport is needed in order to pick up your new pup, that can be arranged with
        the foster/shelter, or you can contact us via our contact page and we can get you in contact with some transport
        companies. </p>

    <h3> Where are your dogs from? </h3>
        <p> The dogs we typically see are from shelters and fosters all over the east coast. Whether it's pitties in Georgia
        or Irish setters in New York, dogs from all over the country are in need of homes. </p>
    <h3> Why do people have to be trained to have dogs? </h3>
        <p> Sadly, a lot of times the reason dogs end up abandoned is because owners don't know what they're getting into by
        committing to a dog. They could possibly not have the stamina, patience, or work ethic for the breed they have or don't
        know how to train them. Suddenly this adorable, innocent puppy that was once so desired is abandoned or even put down
        because their owner didn't know how to stop it from jumping, chewing, nipping, growling or other easily trainable things.
        There is never truly a bad dog, just people who don't know what they're doing. And we are a group that is trying to stop this.</p>
    <h3> Is a dog right for me?</h3>
        <p> The fact that you're asking yourself this is already a good sign. Are you capable of devoting the time, energy, and
        resources to a new family member? If you aren't the most athletic person, there are low energy breeds that would love to
        spend the day just cuddling on the couch. If you work a lot and are out of the house for many hours a day, then a puppy
        wouldn't be the right fit but there are plenty of older dogs that need homes. If you want a puppy just because they look
        cute and you want to show it off to your friends, you might need to consider a different pet that doesn't require as much
        responsibility. We help people match their lifestyle with the right breed and try to stop the cycle of abandonment by
        providing information to the public before this life changing decision is made. <br><br></p>
