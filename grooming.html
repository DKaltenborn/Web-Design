    <h3> Different breeds require different maintenence. But, mostly, dogs need to be take care of in these areas: Fur, Teeth,
      Ears, Nails, Wrinkles, Butt, and in the Tub. </h3>

    <table>
        <tr>
           <th>Fur</th>
           <td> There are many different types of dog hair so there are many different tools you can use depending on if your dog has fur, hair,
           a sinlge coat, double coat, or no coat. Make sure to research what brush is needed for your breed. If your dog has a long coat then you
         should be brushing their coat out daily or every few days. If your dog has a short coat it is even less. If your dog sheds then be prepared
       with shedding tools. </td>
         </tr>
          <tr>
           <th>Teeth</th>
           <td> Dog teeth need to always be looked after and you can do this many different ways. There are dental rinses that you can add to their water,
           dog tooth brushes and dog toothpaste, and even dental dog toys. Or you could just get your dog apples or bones, something to chew on that
         will remove the plaque from their teeth.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
         <th>Ears</th>
         <td> Gunk can build up in your dog's ears and, if left there, can cause an ear infection which is very uncomfortable and painful
         for your dog. Either take an ear wipe or you can use ear drops to clean their ears every few days or weekly (clean them more often
         if you live in a humid area).</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
       <th>Nails</th>
       <td> Make sure to trim your dog's nails weekly. Long nails can make your dog uncomfortable and cause them to slide on smooth floors.
          Make sure to buy a styptic powder or something similar because if you cut your dog's quick (ie where the blood supply is located)
          then there will be a lot of bleeding. Just stay calm, keep a good hold of your pup and put their nail into the powder or whatever
        you have to make the bleeding stop.</td>
    </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Wrinkles</th>
        <td> Dirt can get stuck in dog wrinkles so always make sure when you're grooming your dog (if they have wrinkles) to get a dog wipe and clean those folds. Anything
        leftover can possibly irritate the skin.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Butt</th>
        <td> Sometimes your dog will eat something they shouldn't and it's gotta come out the back end or maybe some poop got stuck and now your pup is frantic. Don't freak out,
          your dog is already doing enough of that. Just be calm, get a dog wipe and hold your pup still. </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
       <th>In The Tub</th>
       <td> One of the most hated self-care for dogs. Some dogs just shut down, some dogs try to run, some are weird and will sit in the tub with a rubber ducky (lucky you).
       You just gotta make sure you're patient with your dog. If you rush or make the experience tramatizing then it will only be harder the next time around. Research your
     shampoo and conditioners to make sure they are good for your breed and get a lot of towels. </td>
