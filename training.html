    <h2> Obedience </h2>

    <p> Everyone wants a good dog. One day they're a cuddling, nipping, toothless puppy but, in a couple months, they're bigger, heavier, fanged and still acting the same.
    People aks themselves "What happened? You're so bad now!" The problem isn't your dog, it's that you haven't started simple obedience training. If you want to be a good owner
  then you need to get your dog to listen to you. If you tell them to do something, they need to do it. If they do something wrong, you need to correct them. Some people think
  "Well it's my dog I'll do whatever I want with it" and that is bad because 1- you obvioulsy are showing that you aren't ready for this responsibility and 2- the dog is not just 'yours' because
  when you get a dog you are inviting it into your community. And, if your dog gets lose, scares, or hurts people in your community, then that is on you (and sadly the dog too). Obedience training
   is a necessity. If you can't get your dog to listen to you and become a member of society, then you have failed as a dog owner. Now, enough of the warnings, obedience training is also a
 great way to bond with your dog! It can be fun for you and be a great exercise for your dog too!</p></div>
    <h2> Tricks </h2>
    Simple Obedience tricks all dogs should know are:
    <ul>
      <li> Sit</li>
      <li> Stay</li>
      <li> Down</li>
      <li> Come Here</li>
      <li> Walk</li>
      <li> Heel</li>
      <li> Leave It</li>
    </ul>
    <p> Eventually, when your dog is getting farther along in their training, you can start with the fun tricks like roll over and play dead. It's good to always be teaching
    your dog. The brainwork gets them tired and is good for their mind as they age. </p>
    <h2> Classes VS Self-teaching </h2>
    <p> Dog classes are a great way to spend time with your dog, practice socialization, and get them trained. If this is your first time having or training a dog, getting professional
    help is necessary.  And the outcome is wonderful. You have a happy dog who knows his tricks and listens to you. This outcome can be acheived with
  self-training. But, again, if you aren't a professional, then get a professional, or maybe even a friend who knows what they're doing. If you want more general information or referrals
